# SFT221 – Workshop 4: Debugging Common Bugs

## Overview
This workshop focuses on recognizing, identifying, and fixing common programming bugs using debugging techniques. You will:
- Run a faulty program and analyze its output.
- Identify bugs using debugging tools and manual inspection.
- Fix the bugs and explain your corrections.
- Reflect on debugging techniques and memory limitations.

## Tasks
### **1. Analyze and Debug the Program**
- **Run the program** and observe incorrect output.
- **Identify and document bugs** using debugging techniques.
- **Fix each bug**, documenting:
  - Bug location (line number).
  - Before and after code.
  - Explanation of the error and fix.
  - Debugging technique used.
- **Repeat the process** until all bugs are fixed.

### **2. Reflection and Research**
Write a document (`reflect.txt`) answering the following:
1. **Most useful debugging technique** – Which method helped the most and why?
2. **Research on number limits:**
   - Maximum integer and double values.
   - Why variables have maximum storage limits.
   - What happens when an integer exceeds its max value.
   - Difference in storing integers vs. floating-point numbers.
3. **Memory management:**
   - Default stack and heap size in Visual Studio.
   - Did you encounter memory limits?
   - Would increasing memory allocation fix the issue? Why or why not?
   - Why are stack and heap sizes limited?

## Deliverables
- **Zipped Visual Studio Project** containing the debugged, working version of the code.
- **Reflection Document (`reflect.txt`)** with research and analysis.
