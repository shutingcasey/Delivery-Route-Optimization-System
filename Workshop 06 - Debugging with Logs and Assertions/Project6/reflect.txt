1. Did you find more bugs using the log file or assertions? 
Why did one work better than the other?

For me, I used assertions to find more bugs.
assertions are more like bodyguardsâ€”they're vigilant and stop at the first sign of trouble.
They're great for catching bugs immediately when they occur.
If you have a hunch about a specific condition causing the issue, assertions can swiftly confirm or deny your suspicions.

2. Do you like to debug using log files or the debugger? 
Why do you prefer one over the other? 
Can you envision a situation where you would only be able to use log files? 
Would you be able to debug as well? 
Would you be able to debug at the same speed as using a debugger, slower or faster?

If I had a debugging preference, I'd probably lean towards logs.
They're leading you through the intricacies of code execution.
I can sift through logs, following the trail of clues to find bugs.
If I only use log files, I'd still be able to help with debugging.
I might not have the real-time interactivity of a debugger, but with detailed logs, I can analyze the sequence of events and offer insights into potential issues.
Yes, I would still to debug as well.
The speed of debugging, however, might differ.
Debuggers provide real-time inspection, letting you pause, inspect variables, and step through code. Logs, while comprehensive, involve a more manual process of analyzing information. So, debugger might be faster for pinpointing issues, but logs can be invaluable for understanding the overall context.

3. How did you gain confidence that you had found all the bugs? 
Would you bet your life savings that you found all the bugs?
If not, what would you do so that you would feel comfortable betting that you had found all the bugs?

It's hard to be 100% confident that every bug is squashed.
I wouldn't bet my life savings on it; bugs have a sneaky way of surprising you.
I will exhaustive testing helps, but it's never foolproof.
Different inputs and scenarios can unveil new bugs.
