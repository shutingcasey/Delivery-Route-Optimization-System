# SFT221 – Workshop 6: Debugging with Logs and Assertions

## Overview
This workshop focuses on using **log files** and **assertions** to find and fix bugs. You will:
- Use the **log4c** library to generate log statements.
- Insert **assertions** to catch invalid program states.
- Compare debugging with logs/assertions versus using a debugger.

**⚠ DO NOT use the debugger!** This workshop is designed to compare log-based debugging with traditional debugging.

## Tasks
### **1. Debug Using Logs and Assertions**
- **Use log4c** to add logging statements to track program execution.
- **Insert assertions** to detect invalid values and impossible program states.
- **Find and fix bugs**, documenting:
  - Bug location (line number).
  - Corrected version of the line.
  - Explanation of the bug and fix.
  - Debugging tool (log file or assertion) used to find the bug.
- **Ensure assertions remain** in the final version to help detect future bugs.

### **2. Reflection and Research**
Write a document (`reflect.txt`) answering the following:
1. **Log files vs. Assertions** – Which method found more bugs? Why?
2. **Preference for Debugging Tools** – Do you prefer log files or a debugger? Why? In what situations would logs be the only option?
3. **Confidence in Debugging** – How sure are you that all bugs were found? Would you bet your life savings on it? If not, what would improve your confidence?

## Deliverables
- **Zipped Visual Studio Project** containing:
  - Debugged, working code.
  - Log file and assertion statements.
- **Generated log file** used for debugging.
- **Bug Report Document (`bug_report.txt`)** with:
  - Bug locations.
  - Corrected code.
  - Explanation of each bug and fix.
  - Debugging method used (log file or assertion).
- **Reflection Document (`reflect.txt`)** answering the provided questions.
