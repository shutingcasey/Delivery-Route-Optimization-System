# SFT221 – Workshop 5: Debugging with Visual Studio

## Overview
This workshop focuses on using the **Visual Studio Debugger** to identify and fix bugs in a program that indexes a string by:
- Finding the start of each line.
- Finding the start of each word.
- Finding the start of each number.

You will use the debugger exclusively to identify and fix the bugs—**do not use print statements or other debugging methods**.

## Tasks
### **1. Identify and Fix Bugs**
- **Run the program** using the Visual Studio Debugger.
- **Use debugging tools** (breakpoints, watch variables, step-through execution, etc.) to identify errors.
- **Fix each bug** and document:
  - The line number containing the bug.
  - The corrected version of the line.
  - Explanation of the error and how you fixed it.
  - The debugging tool or technique used to find the bug.
- **Repeat the debugging process** until all bugs are fixed.

### **2. Reflection and Research**
Write a document (`reflect.txt`) answering the following:
1. **Most useful debugger tool** – Which debugging tool helped the most and why?
2. **Debugger features not used** – Which features did you not use, why, and when would they be useful?
3. **Best debugging approach** – Which method is best: 
   - Using only the debugger,
   - Using only print statements,
   - Using both? Justify your answer.
4. **Testing strategies** – How did you test for bugs and verify fixes? Did you use additional test data? How confident are you that all bugs were found?

## Deliverables
- **Zipped Visual Studio Project** containing the debugged, working version of the code.
- **Bug Report Document (`bug_report.txt`)** with:
  - Bug locations.
  - Corrected code.
  - Explanation of each bug and fix.
  - Debugging tool used.
- **Reflection Document (`reflect.txt`)** answering the provided questions.
