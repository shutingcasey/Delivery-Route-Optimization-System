# Workshop 1: Testing and Debugging

## Overview
This workshop focuses on testing and debugging a C program that checks if a string starts or ends with a given substring.
- Test the provided functions.
- Identify and analyze bugs.
- Fix the bugs and explain your solutions.
- Reflect on testing vs. inspection effectiveness.

## Tasks
1. **Test the Code**
   - Write and run test cases.
   - Describe test purpose and results.
   - Identify discovered bugs.

2. **Inspect for Bugs**
   - Manually review the code.
   - Find any additional bugs.
   - Write tests if needed to confirm issues.

3. **Debug the Code**
   - Fix the identified bugs.
   - Show before-and-after code snippets.
   - Explain how the fix works.

4. **Reflection**
   - Compare testing vs. inspection effectiveness.
   - Discuss debugging challenges and solutions.

## Deliverables
- **Test cases and results.**
- **Identified bugs and fixes.**
- **Reflection on testing and debugging.**
